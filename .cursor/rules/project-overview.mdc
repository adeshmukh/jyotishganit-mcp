# jyotishganit-mcp Overview

This repository implements an **MCP (Model Context Protocol) server** that wraps the [jyotishganit](https://pypi.org/project/jyotishganit/) library for Vedic astrology calculations. Cursor and other MCP clients can call tools/resources exposed by this server to compute birth charts, panchanga, dashas, etc.

## Architecture

- **MCP server** (this repo): Exposes tools/resources via the MCP Python SDK (`mcp` on PyPI).
- **jyotishganit**: Core calculation library (PyPI: `jyotishganit>=0.1.2`). High-precision Vedic astrology using NASA JPL ephemeris.

## Key Dependencies

- `mcp>=1.0` — MCP Python SDK (requires Python >= 3.10)
- `jyotishganit>=0.1.2` — Vedic astrology calculations

## Directory Layout

- `src/jyotishganit_mcp/` — MCP server package (entry point, tools, resources)
- `tests/` — Pytest test suite
- `../jyotishganit/` — Forked source of jyotishganit (peer directory, for reference only; do not depend on local path in code)

## Conventions

- Use `ruff` for linting and formatting, `mypy` for type checking, `pytest` for tests.
- Package is installed in editable mode for development: `pip install -e ".[dev]"`.
